1. DATASET OVERVIEW
------------------
• Number of images analyzed: 64
• Feature dimension (flattened pixels): 196608
• Total pixels analyzed: 12,582,912
• Memory size: 96.0 MB

2. PREPROCESSING (PCA)
---------------------
• PCA reduced dimension from 196608 to 50
• Variance retained by PCA: 93.852%
• Purpose: Speed up t-SNE computation while preserving structure

3. t-SNE PARAMETERS
------------------
• t-SNE dimensions: 2D (for visualization)
• Perplexities tested: [5, 15, 30, 50]
• Selected perplexity: 30
• Number of iterations: 1000
• Random seed: 42

4. KEY FINDINGS
--------------
• t-SNE successfully embedded 64 samples into 2D space
• Different perplexity values tested to find optimal local/global balance
• Clustering in t-SNE space reveals natural groupings in the data
• Pairwise distances show distribution of similarities between images

5. t-SNE INTERPRETATION
---------------------
• t-SNE preserves local structure: Nearby points in t-SNE space are similar
• Global structure may be distorted (this is normal for t-SNE)
• Clusters represent groups of similar images
• Distances between clusters indicate dissimilarity between image groups

6. VISUALIZATIONS GENERATED
--------------------------
• tsne_perplexity_comparison.png - Comparison of different perplexities
• tsne_detailed_analysis.png - Detailed analysis with multiple views
• tsne_with_labels.png - t-SNE plot with sample labels
• tsne_cluster_analysis.png - K-means clustering results

7. DATA FILES
------------
• tsne_perplexity*.npy - t-SNE embeddings for each perplexity
• tsne_summary.json - t-SNE analysis parameters and summary

8. HOW TO INTERPRET RESULTS
-------------------------
1. Look for clusters - groups of points that are close together
2. Check if similar images cluster together in t-SNE space
3. Compare different perplexities to see stability of structure
4. Use sample labels to identify which images are in which clusters
5. Clusters with high silhouette scores are more distinct

9. LIMITATIONS
-------------
• t-SNE is stochastic - different runs may give slightly different results
• Global distances may not be preserved (focus is on local structure)
• Requires careful choice of perplexity parameter
• Computationally expensive for large datasets

10. CONCLUSIONS
--------------
t-SNE reveals the underlying structure of your generated images in a 
2-dimensional space that humans can visualize. The presence of clear 
clusters suggests that your images have distinct groups or styles.
