2. CLUSTER DISTRIBUTION
----------------------
• Cluster 0: 43 images (67.2%)
• Cluster 1: 21 images (32.8%)

3. GENDER ANALYSIS
-----------------

Cluster 0:
• Size: 43 images
• Jaw strength: 0.325
• Brow contrast: 0.356
• Gender estimation: Potentially male
• Sample images: [0, 1, 4, 5, 6]

• Brow contrast: 0.322
• Gender estimation: Potentially male
• Sample images: [2, 3, 7, 8, 10]

4. AGE ANALYSIS
--------------

Cluster 0:
• Texture energy: 0.043 (higher = more wrinkles)
• Smoothness: 0.068 (higher = smoother skin)
• Contrast: 0.354 (higher = more age-related contrast)
• Age estimation: Potentially older

Cluster 1:
• Texture energy: 0.031 (higher = more wrinkles)
• Smoothness: 0.049 (higher = smoother skin)
• Contrast: 0.285 (higher = more age-related contrast)
• Age estimation: Potentially older

5. ETHNICITY ANALYSIS
--------------------

Cluster 0:
• Average skin tone (RGB): (0.69, 0.61, 0.38)
• Brightness: 0.69
• Saturation: 0.46
• Ethnicity estimation: Mixed or unclear

Cluster 1:
• Average skin tone (RGB): (0.53, 0.42, 0.16)
• Brightness: 0.53
• Saturation: 0.69
• Ethnicity estimation: Potentially medium/warm skin tone

6. KEY FINDINGS
--------------
• Check cluster collages in: focused_cluster_analysis_20251204_145913/clusters/
• Examine visual patterns in each cluster
• Compare with human perception of gender/age/ethnicity
• Note: These are algorithmic estimates and may not be accurate

7. RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------
1. Manually verify cluster assignments
2. Look for consistent visual patterns in each cluster
3. Consider merging clusters if patterns are similar
4. Use these findings as a starting point for deeper analysis

8. VISUALIZATIONS
