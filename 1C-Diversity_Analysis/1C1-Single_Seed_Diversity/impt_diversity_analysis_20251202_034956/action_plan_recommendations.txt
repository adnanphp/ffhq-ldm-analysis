FFHQ FACE GENERATION - ACTION PLAN & RECOMMENDATIONS
=====================================================
Generated: 2025-12-02 07:15:05

PROBLEM STATEMENT
-----------------
Current model generates faces with:
• 0% novelty (all faces very similar)
• 8.3% recall (poor distribution coverage)
• 98.4% average similarity
• Limited pose variation

IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Week 1)
--------------------------
1. DIFFERENT RANDOM SEEDS
   • Try seeds 1-1000 (currently using limited range)
   • Implement seed sweeping function
   • Document best seeds for diversity

2. INCREASE GUIDANCE SCALE
   • Test guidance scales: 10, 12, 15, 20
   • Find optimal balance between quality and diversity
   • Current optimal: 3.0 (too low for diversity)

3. DIVERSITY-PROMOTING SAMPLING
   • Increase sampling temperature
   • Try different sampling algorithms:
     - PLMS (Pseudolinear Multistep)
     - DPM-Solver
     - Euler Ancestral
   • Implement noise injection in latent space

4. LARGER BATCH GENERATION
   • Generate 100+ faces for better analysis
   • Use batch size 8-16 for efficiency
   • Create diversity benchmark with 500 faces

TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS (Week 2-3)
---------------------------------
1. NOISE INJECTION
   • Add noise to latent vectors before decoding
   • Implement controlled noise levels (0.1-0.3)
   • Test effect on diversity metrics

2. SAMPLING ALGORITHM COMPARISON
   • Implement and compare:
     - DDIM (current)
     - PLMS
     - DPM-Solver ++
     - Euler Ancestral
   • Measure diversity impact of each algorithm

3. TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENT
   • Adjust model temperature parameter
   • Higher temperature = more diversity
   • Find optimal temperature for face generation

4. CONDITIONAL GENERATION
   • Add control over:
     - Age groups
     - Gender
     - Ethnicity
     - Facial expression
   • Implement classifier-free guidance

LONG-TERM STRATEGIES (Month 2-3)
--------------------------------
1. MODEL FINE-TUNING
   • Fine-tune on more diverse face dataset
   • Implement diversity loss during training
   • Transfer learning from other face models

2. ARCHITECTURE EXPLORATION
   • Compare with StyleGAN2/3
   • Try different latent diffusion variants
   • Explore autoencoder improvements

3. PRODUCTION READINESS
   • GPU acceleration implementation
   • Web interface with Gradio/Streamlit
   • Batch generation API
   • Quality filtering system

EXPERIMENT PROTOCOL
-------------------
For each improvement, measure:
1. Novelty percentage (target: >70%)
2. Recall score (target: >0.5)
3. Average similarity (target: <0.7)
4. Pose diversity (target: >0.5)
5. Generation time per face

SUCCESS METRICS
---------------
TARGET METRICS (1 month):
• Novelty: >50% unique faces
• Recall: >0.3 distribution coverage
• Average similarity: <0.8
• Pose diversity: >0.3

TARGET METRICS (3 months):
• Novelty: >80% unique faces
• Recall: >0.6 distribution coverage
• Average similarity: <0.6
• Pose diversity: >0.6
• Generation speed: >1 img/sec (GPU)

RESOURCE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------
• GPU access (for speed improvement)
• Additional 20GB storage for generated faces
• Python development environment
• Monitoring and evaluation tools

RISK MITIGATION
---------------
• Backup all generated faces regularly
• Document all parameter changes
• Use version control for code
• Regular evaluation checkpoints

TIMELINE
--------
Week 1-2: Immediate actions implementation
Week 3-4: Technical improvements
Month 2: Model comparison and optimization
Month 3: Production readiness and documentation
